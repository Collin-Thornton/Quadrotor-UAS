# Quadrotor-UAS 

The purpose of this project is to develop a dynamic controller for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

The file main6.0.ino is an working version of the controller, developed in high school. While this code does not include a dynamic controller, 
it does use nested PID loops to implement angular stabilization.

The folder Quadrotor-UAS is currently in progress. Primary work includes implementing a Kalman filter and force controller.
